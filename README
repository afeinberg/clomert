The goal of clomert is to provide an idiomatic Voldemort client for
Clojure. It's a simpler task due to the ease of Clojure to Java
interoperability. For example, Clojure's first order maps and vectors
implement Java's Map and List interfaces: the zipcode example in src/
directory shows the benefit of this when it comes to Voldemort's
serialization layer. Clojure's interactive nature also makes it
possible to use Clojure REPL as client shell for Voldemort,
particularly in combination with the rich editing and debugging
capabilities of SLIME.

This is an early version with many rough edges. I'm developing it out
in the open to get people's feedback and contributions.

Note: presently the Voldemort jar files aren't yet in a Maven
repository, so you will need to manually install them before running
"lein deps":

mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=voldemort -DartifactId=voldemort \
-Dversion=0.81 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/tmp/voldemort-0.81.jar

mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=voldemort \
-DartifactId=voldemort-contrib -Dversion=0.81 -Dpackaging=jar \
-Dfile=/tmp/voldemort-contrib-0.81.jar

Feedback, criticism and patches are welcome.
