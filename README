This is an early version with many rough edges. I'm developing it out
in the open to get people's feedback and contribution. Quick note:
presently, this doesn't come "batteries included" i.e., I haven't
setup dependencies in leiningen. To use this, you need to:

1) Run "lein deps"

2) Copy the files out of the lib/ directory of a voldemort tree (a
clone of the git repository or a release tar/zip archive) into the lib
directory of this project.

Feedback, criticism and patches are welcome.
